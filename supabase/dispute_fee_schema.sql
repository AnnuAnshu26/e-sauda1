-- Run this in Supabase Dashboard -> SQL Editor -> New query -> Run.
-- feature/dispute-fee: when a buyer cancels a funded Vault order that already has a
-- delivery rider arranged (assigned or already delivered), the refund deducts that
-- rider's fee instead of refunding the full amount — "keeping the ecosystem fair for
-- transit riders" per the blueprint's dispute protocol. If no delivery was ever
-- arranged (an in-person meetup), cancelling still refunds the full amount — there's
-- no logistics cost to recover.
--
-- HONEST SCOPE NOTE: as with vault_orders and deliveries, no real money moves. This
-- records what a real refund/deduction would be (refund_amount, deducted_fee) so the
-- UI can show it accurately — swapping in a real payment gateway later means actually
-- transferring refund_amount instead of amount, nothing else in this flow changes.
--
-- Prerequisite: supabase/vault_schema.sql and supabase/delivery_schema.sql must
-- already be applied.
