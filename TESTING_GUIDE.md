# e-Sauda — Full Manual Testing Guide

This is a click-through checklist for every page, button, and flow in the app,
organized by role (Buyer, Seller, Admin) and then by feature. Use three
browser profiles/incognito windows (or three test accounts) so you can be
buyer, seller, and admin at the same time without logging in/out constantly.

Before you start, read the "Setup prerequisites" section — several features
will look broken if the underlying Supabase migration or secret hasn't been
applied yet, and that's a config issue, not a code bug.

---

## 0. Setup prerequisites (do this first)

- [ ] All SQL files in `supabase/` have been run, **in the order their setup
      docs say** (several depend on an earlier one — e.g.
      `listing_fee_schema.sql` needs `razorpay_schema.sql` first). If you're
      not sure what's already applied, re-running a migration that uses
      `create or replace` / `if not exists` is safe.
- [ ] `video_upload_schema.sql` and `image_upload_schema.sql` have been run
      (Sell now requires a video on every new listing — see §3).
- [ ] Supabase Edge Function secrets are set:
      `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` / `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` — **use your `rzp_test_...`
      key**, not a live key, until you're ready to accept real payments (see
      `RAZORPAY_SETUP.md`). All ten functions in `supabase/functions/` are
      deployed (`supabase functions deploy <name>` for each, or `--all` if
      your CLI version supports it).
- [ ] `.env` / Vercel project env vars have `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and
      `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` set.
- [ ] `npm install && npm run build` completes with no errors (this was
      verified clean as of this branch — if it breaks after further changes,
      fix that before testing UI behavior on top of a broken build).

---

## 1. Account creation & auth (test as a brand-new user)

Route: `/signup`, `/login`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`,
`/verify-phone`

- [ ] Sign up with a new email + password → confirm you land signed-in (or
      get a clear "check your email" message if email confirmation is on in
      your Supabase Auth settings).
- [ ] Try signing up with an email already in use → confirm a clear error,
      not a silent failure.
- [W] Log out, log back in with the same credentials → works.
- [W] Log in with a wrong password → clear error, no crash.
- [ ] **Forgot password**: request a reset → check the email arrives → click
      the link → land on `/reset-password` → set a new password → log in
      with the new one.
- [ ] **Phone verification** (`/verify-phone`, gated behind `RequireAuth`):
      request an OTP → confirm it's sent (check `send-phone-otp` function
      logs if it doesn't arrive) → enter it → confirm it verifies → enter a
      wrong OTP → confirm a clear rejection, not a crash.
- [ ] Try visiting any `RequireAuth`-gated route (`/sell`, `/my-listings`,
      `/orders`, `/vault`, `/profile`, `/saved`, `/admin`, `/messages`,
      `/listing/:id/edit`) while logged out → confirm you're redirected to
      login rather than seeing a broken/empty page.

---

## 2. Browse & search (as any logged-in or logged-out user)

Route: `/` (Home) and `/browse`

- [ ] Home page loads, shows a "fresh listings" grid without erroring even on
      an empty database.
- [ ] Home page's feature list no longer mentions voice or AR (confirm: it
      should read "Vaulted escrow", "Progressive trust limits", "One-tap city
      delivery", "AI-cleaned photos" only — four cards, not the old six).
- [ ] Category tabs on `/browse` (All / Mobiles / Vehicles / etc.) filter the
      grid correctly.
- [ ] Search box: type a term that matches a listing title → results narrow
      after the debounce (~350ms). Type something matching nothing → the
      "No listings match..." empty state shows, not a blank screen or error.
- [ ] Search box is also reachable from the Navbar and deep-links to
      `/browse?q=...` — confirm the URL updates and is shareable/refreshable.
- [ ] **City filter** (left sidebar, "Filters" → "City"): select a specific
      city → confirm the grid narrows to listings whose location contains
      that city; select "All cities" → confirm it resets. (This filter was
      previously non-functional — verify it now actually filters, and that
      it combines correctly with category/price/search filters at the same
      time.)
- [ ] Price Min/Max fields filter correctly, and combine correctly with
      category + city + search all at once.
- [ ] Sort dropdown: "Price: Low to High", "Price: High to Low", "Nearest
      first" all reorder the grid as expected.
- [ ] Each listing card shows: price, title, location + distance, an Escrow
      badge (every listing should have this — escrow is always on),
      ✓ Verified badge only for verified sellers. **Confirm there is no AR
      badge and no 360° badge anywhere** — those were removed along with the
      feature.
- [ ] Heart/save icon on a card: toggles filled/unfilled instantly; if
      logged in, confirm it persists (reload the page, still saved); if
      logged out, confirm it still visually toggles locally without erroring
      (it just won't persist).
- [ ] "Have something to sell?" CTA at the bottom of Browse links to `/sell`
      and its copy no longer mentions "voice-first" or "20 seconds."

---

## 3. Posting a listing — Seller flow (the big one)

Route: `/sell` (requires login)

### Step 0 — Category
- [ ] Pick each category button → confirms it highlights and the "Listing
      cap in {category}" banner above updates to show your current count for
      that category (fetches live from Supabase).
- [ ] Sub-category free-text field accepts input.
- [ ] If you're at your cap (2 active listings in one category by default),
      confirm the red "You've hit your listing cap" warning shows and the
      **Next** button is disabled.
- [ ] Otherwise confirm the anti-bot fee preview shows (₹1 for your 1st
      listing in that category, ₹10 for the 2nd, ₹25/₹500 tier beyond) and
      updates live if you switch categories.

### Step 1 — Details
- [ ] Confirm there is **no "Speak instead" / microphone button** anywhere
      on this step — that was removed along with the rest of voice.
- [ ] Title, Price, Condition, Description fields all accept and retain
      input when you go Back and Next again (state isn't lost mid-wizard).
- [ ] Price suggestion box: after picking a category (and optionally typing
      a sub-category), wait ~400ms → confirm it either shows a real
      suggested range from existing listings, or a "not enough similar
      listings yet" message — never stuck on "Checking similar listings…"
      forever.
- [ ] Click "Use ₹X" on the suggestion → confirms it fills the Price field.
- [ ] **Location field** (new): type a city/area → confirm it's required —
      Next stays disabled with Title/Price filled in but Location empty.
      Fill it in → Next enables.
- [ ] Next button overall: disabled unless Title, Price, and Location are
      all non-empty (and you're not at your category cap).

### Step 2 — Media
- [ ] **Photos** (optional): upload up to 6 images, remove any with the ×
      that appears on hover, confirm you can publish with zero photos (the
      listing just shows a category emoji instead — this is intentional,
      only video is mandatory).
- [ ] Try uploading a photo over the size limit or wrong file type → confirm
      a clear error, not a crash.
- [ ] **Video (new, mandatory)**: confirm you **cannot click Next** without
      adding a video first.
  - [ ] Upload a short (<60s) real video file → confirm "Checking video…"
        appears briefly, then a preview player renders with a working ×
        remove button, and Next becomes enabled.
  - [ ] Try a video over 60 seconds → confirm a clear duration error and it's
        rejected (not silently accepted).
  - [ ] Try a video over 50MB → confirm a clear size error.
  - [ ] Try renaming a non-video file (e.g. a `.txt`) to `.mp4` and uploading
        it → confirm the type/duration check actually catches it rather than
        trusting the extension.
  - [ ] Remove the video after adding it → confirm Next becomes disabled
        again until you add another.

### Step 3 — Review & publish
- [ ] Review screen shows correct Category, Title, Location, Price,
      Condition, Description, Photos count, Video filename, and the
      anti-bot fee due.
- [ ] Click "Pay ₹X & publish" → Razorpay Checkout modal opens (test mode —
      see §8). Pay with the test card `4111 1111 1111 1111` (any future
      expiry/CVV).
- [ ] Confirm the button label changes through the real states: "Publishing…"
      → "Uploading photos…" (if any) → "Uploading video…" → success screen.
- [ ] On success: confirm the listing published message shows, and if photo
      or video upload failed independently (simulate by killing your network
      briefly during upload), confirm you get a clear warning pointing to
      **My Listings → Edit** to add it — and that the listing itself still
      published rather than being lost.
- [ ] Close the Razorpay modal without paying (click the X) → confirm this is
      treated as "cancelled," not shown as a scary error.
- [ ] Use the Razorpay test UPI ID `failure@razorpay` → confirm you get a
      clear "Payment failed" message.
- [ ] Go to `/browse` → confirm your new listing appears with the correct
      location, and that the City filter can find it.
- [ ] Open the new listing's detail page → confirm the video plays under the
      photo gallery, and **confirm there is no AR/"View in AR" section**
      anywhere on the page — that feature and its dimension inputs were
      removed entirely.

---

## 4. Editing & managing listings — Seller flow

Route: `/my-listings`, `/listing/:id/edit`

- [ ] `/my-listings` lists all of your listings (active, sold, removed) with
      correct status.
- [ ] Click Edit on a listing → confirm Title/Price/Condition/Description/
      Location/City load pre-filled correctly.
- [ ] Confirm there is **no "Dimensions (optional)" section** on the edit
      page — removed with AR.
- [ ] Change a field, Save → confirm it saves and redirects back to the
      listing detail page with the update reflected.
- [ ] Photos section: add a photo, remove a photo → confirm each change
      saves immediately (not deferred to a form submit).
- [ ] Video section: if the listing has no video (an old listing from before
      this feature), confirm it shows a clean "Add a video" upload prompt,
      not a broken player. Add one → confirm it saves and now shows on the
      listing detail page. Replace it, then remove it → both should work and
      persist.
- [ ] Try editing a listing that belongs to someone else (change the URL id)
      → confirm you're blocked ("forbidden" state), not shown their data.
- [ ] Try editing a listing id that doesn't exist → confirm a clean
      "not found" state, not a crash.
- [ ] Mark a listing as sold (wherever that control lives per
      `MARK_AS_SOLD_SETUP.md`) → confirm its status updates and it drops out
      of the public Browse feed.
- [ ] Delete/remove a listing from `/my-listings` → confirm the confirmation
      step works and it's actually removed (or marked removed) afterward.

---

## 5. Listing detail & buyer purchase flow

Route: `/listing/:id`

- [ ] All fields render: title, price, condition, description, location,
      photos gallery, video (if present), seller info, Escrow badge.
- [ ] Save/heart button toggles and persists for logged-in users.
- [ ] "Message seller" opens/creates a conversation and routes to
      `/messages/:id`.
- [ ] "Buy with Vault" button → opens Razorpay Checkout (test mode) for the
      **listing's real price**, not something editable by the buyer. Try
      intercepting the request in devtools to change the amount — confirm
      the server (Edge Function) still charges the real DB price, since the
      amount is read server-side.
- [ ] Complete a test payment → confirms a Vault order is created and shows
      up on both your `/vault` (Buying tab) and the seller's `/vault`
      (Selling tab).
- [ ] Report button on the listing → submits a report, confirm it appears in
      `/admin` for review (see §9).
- [ ] "You might also like" / recommendations section loads without erroring
      even for a listing with few similar items.
- [ ] Confirm again: **no AR try-on control anywhere** on this page.

---

## 6. Messaging & offers

Route: `/messages`, `/messages/:id`

- [ ] Conversation list loads, shows correct last message preview and
      timestamp.
- [ ] Send a message → appears instantly for you, and (open a second
      browser/account) appears in near-real-time for the other party.
- [ ] Send a message containing something that should trigger moderation
      (per `CHAT_MODERATION_SETUP.md`, e.g. sharing a phone number) → confirm
      it's flagged/handled as documented, not silently allowed if the docs
      say it shouldn't be.
- [ ] Make a price offer inline in chat (per chat-offers feature) → confirm
      it renders as a distinct offer bubble with Accept/Decline/Withdraw
      controls visible to the correct party only.
- [ ] Accept an offer as the seller → confirm the buyer sees it reflected as
      accepted, and that this connects correctly to the price used at
      checkout (per `fetchMyAcceptedOffer`).
- [ ] Decline / withdraw an offer → confirm state updates correctly on both
      sides.
- [ ] Block a user (per `blocking_schema.sql` / `MODERATION_ACTIONS_AND_BLOCKING_SETUP.md`)
      → confirm you no longer receive messages from them and can't message
      them back.
- [ ] Chatbot widget (bottom corner, all pages) → open it, ask a question →
      confirm it responds via the `chat-assistant` Edge Function rather than
      failing silently.

---

## 7. Vault (escrow), OTP handover, delivery, cancellation

Route: `/vault`

**As buyer (Buying tab):**
- [ ] Funded order shows "FUNDS SECURED" status clearly.
- [ ] Arrange delivery (Rapido/Uber/Dunzo per `DELIVERY_SETUP.md`) → confirm
      a rider/partner, ETA, and fee show and persist.
- [ ] Reveal handover OTP → confirm a 4–6 digit code displays only to you.
- [ ] Mark delivered (if applicable) → confirms status updates.
- [ ] Cancel an order with a reason → confirm the refund amount shown makes
      sense (full refund if no delivery arranged yet; a reduced amount if a
      delivery fee had already been committed, per `DISPUTE_FEE_SETUP.md`) →
      confirm the cancellation actually triggers `cancel-vault-order-and-refund`
      and the Razorpay refund shows up (in test mode, check the Razorpay
      Dashboard's test-mode payments).

**As seller (Selling tab):**
- [ ] See the same order show up as a sale.
- [ ] Enter the OTP the buyer revealed → confirm it completes the order and
      releases funds (status → completed) only on a correct OTP; a wrong OTP
      is rejected with a clear error, not silently accepted.
- [ ] After completion, confirm a rating prompt/flow becomes available (see
      §8) and the listing's status becomes "sold" if that's tied together.

---

## 8. Payments — Razorpay test mode

This must be done with Razorpay **test** keys (`rzp_test_...`) set as your
Supabase secrets — see `RAZORPAY_SETUP.md` for the exact `supabase secrets
set` commands. The frontend code itself doesn't hardcode test vs. live; it
uses whatever key the `create-razorpay-order` Edge Function returns, so
**being in test mode is entirely a matter of which key is configured
server-side**, not something to toggle in the UI.

- [ ] Listing-fee payment (Sell wizard's "Pay ₹X & publish") completes with
      test card `4111 1111 1111 1111`.
- [ ] Vault/escrow payment ("Buy with Vault") completes with the same test
      card.
- [ ] Test UPI `success@razorpay` completes successfully on both flows.
- [ ] Test UPI `failure@razorpay` fails cleanly on both flows with a message
      the user can actually understand.
- [ ] Refund (from a cancelled Vault order) shows up as a test-mode refund in
      the Razorpay Dashboard.
- [ ] Confirm **no real card details ever need to be entered** — if the
      checkout modal is asking for a real card, your keys are live, not
      test; stop and fix the Supabase secret before continuing to test.

---

## 9. Ratings, notifications, saved items, price alerts

- [ ] After a completed Vault order, rate the other party (stars + comment)
      → confirm it saves and shows on their `/seller/:id` public profile.
- [ ] Notifications bell/page: confirm you get a notification for new
      messages, funded vault orders, completed orders, cancelled orders, and
      report outcomes — click through each to confirm it deep-links
      correctly and marks itself read.
- [ ] `/saved`: confirm every listing you hearted shows up here, and
      unsaving from either Browse or here keeps both in sync.
- [ ] Price drop alert: as a seller, drop a listing's price → confirm buyers
      who saved it get a notification (per `FORGOT_PASSWORD_AND_PRICE_DROP_SETUP.md`).

---

## 10. Account & profile

Route: `/profile`, `/seller/:id`

- [ ] `/profile` shows correct trust score, completed saudas, active listing
      count (links through to `/my-listings`), saved count.
- [ ] "Verify with DigiLocker" button is disabled and labeled "Coming soon" —
      confirm it's not clickable and doesn't pretend to do something it
      can't (this was a dead button before; it's intentionally disabled now
      until the integration actually exists).
- [ ] Badges section reflects real unlocked/locked state based on your
      actual activity, not hardcoded.
- [ ] Dark mode toggle: confirm it actually switches theme, and persists on
      reload (check `useTheme.ts` / the inline script in `index.html` agree
      with each other — no flash of wrong theme on load).
- [ ] Account deletion flow (per `LISTING_FEE_AND_ACCOUNT_DELETION_SETUP.md`)
      → confirm it requires confirmation, actually calls the
      `delete-account` function, and you're logged out and can no longer log
      back in with those credentials afterward.
- [ ] `/seller/:id` public profile: shows their rating, review count, active
      listings — confirm it does **not** leak private info (email, phone)
      to other users.

---

## 11. Admin role

Route: `/admin` (any logged-in user can currently reach the route — confirm
whether admin-only access is enforced at the Supabase RLS/role level per
`ADMIN_REPORTS_SETUP.md`; if a non-admin account can see this page and act on
reports, that's a real access-control bug worth flagging separately from
this checklist)

- [ ] Tabs: Open / Reviewed / Dismissed / All — each filters the reports
      list correctly.
- [ ] Mark a report Reviewed → moves out of "Open" into "Reviewed" (and
      shows in "All").
- [ ] Dismiss a report → same, moves to "Dismissed."
- [ ] "Remove listing" action on a report → confirm the listing actually
      disappears from Browse afterward.
- [ ] "Suspend user" action → confirm that user can no longer post new
      listings (they should see the "Account suspended" message if they try
      `/sell`) and confirm what happens to their existing listings per
      `MODERATION_ACTIONS_AND_BLOCKING_SETUP.md`.
- [ ] Reload the admin page after each action → confirm state matches what
      the DB actually has (not just an optimistic local update that would
      revert on refresh if the backend call silently failed).

---

## 12. Legal & static pages

Route: `/terms`, `/privacy`, `/refund-policy`, `/shipping-policy`,
`/contact`, `/pricing`

- [ ] All six load with real content, not placeholder/lorem-ipsum text.
- [ ] Footer links to all six work and match what's linked in the Navbar (if
      linked there too).
- [ ] Pricing page's stated fees (anti-bot listing fee tiers, delivery fees,
      dispute fees) match what the app actually charges at each of those
      points — cross-check against §3 and §7 above.
- [ ] Footer's "coming soon" list (DigiLocker verification, etc.) — confirm
      every item still listed there is genuinely not live yet; if any of
      them get built later, remove them from "coming soon" at the same time
      or the site will contradict itself again.

---

## 13. Cross-cutting / regression checks

- [ ] **Voice**: search the whole app one more time for any remaining
      mention of "voice," "speak," "microphone," or a mic icon — there
      should be none. (`grep -ri "voice\|microphone" src` should return
      nothing.)
- [ ] **AR**: search for "AR," "model-viewer," "SpaceFitViewer," "spin360" —
      there should be none in app code. (`grep -rn "model-viewer\|SpaceFitViewer\|spin360" src`
      should return nothing.)
- [ ] **Location consistency**: every new listing has a non-empty location;
      Browse's City filter actually narrows results; a listing's location
      shown on its card matches what was typed at posting time.
- [ ] **Video consistency**: every listing created *after* this change has a
      video; listings created *before* this change simply don't show a video
      section (not a broken player).
- [ ] Run `npm run build` — must complete with zero TypeScript errors.
- [ ] Click every nav link in the Navbar (logged-out and logged-in states
      look different — check both) and every link in the Footer — none
      should 404 or dead-end.
- [ ] Resize to mobile width and re-check Sell's wizard, Vault's tabs, and
      Browse's filter sidebar — confirm nothing overlaps or becomes
      unreachable on a small screen.

---

## Known items intentionally left as-is (not bugs)

- **Photos remain optional** on the Sell wizard — only video is mandatory,
  by design (see `MANDATORY_VIDEO_SETUP.md`).
- **Existing listings from before this branch** have no video and aren't
  retroactively required to add one — this is intentional, not a gap.
- **DigiLocker verification** is a real, disabled, honestly-labeled
  "Coming soon" button on `/profile` — it is not wired to anything yet.
  Treat wiring it up as a separate feature, not a bug in this pass.
